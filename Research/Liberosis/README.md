# Liberosis

Liberosis: The desire to care less about things. 
n. the desire to care less about things—to loosen your grip on your life, to stop glancing behind 
you every few steps, afraid that someone will snatch it from you before you reach the end zone—rather
to hold your life loosely and playfully, like a volleyball, keeping it in the air, with only quick 
fleeting interventions, bouncing freely in the hands of trusted friends, always in play.
