# Onism

Onism - n. the frustration of being stuck in just one body, that inhabits only one place at a
time, which is like standing in front of the departures screen at an airport, flickering over
with strange place names like other people's passwords, each representing one more thing you'll
never get to see before you die-and all because, as the arrow on the map helpfully points out,
you are here.
